In the Module 3 Challenge: Python, we work on opening, reading, and writing to files.

In PyBank, we perform financial analysis on a company's data comprised of dates and profit/loss. The data allows us to calculate the total months in the dataset, total profit/loss, average change in profit/loss, and greatest increase and decrease in profit/loss, by iterating through a for loop that reads each row in the dataset.

In PyPoll, we analyze the results of an election, determining the total number of votes cast, the number of candidates, how many votes each received, and the winner of the election.
